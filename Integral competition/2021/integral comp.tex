\section{Cross integral}

%Crossintegral - look up how to make a crossword
%UKMT instructions https://www.ukmt.org.uk/sites/default/files/ukmt/ptmr/ptmr-sample-crossnumber.pdf, 20 minutes long

% LOOK AT PEIRANS DMS ON DISCORD

%his advice is to rank the clues as follows:

%how flexible the digits are (is it easy to change a certain digit or even the number of digits to fit the rest of the puzzle just by tweaking a parameter in the clue?)

%Deterministic (do you need to know certain digits to determine a unique answer?)

%Difficulty

%Then I would roughly put in the clues in ascending order of flexibility, while balancing the difficulty, and crucially (since the columns team members are supposed to work with the rows team members) making sure that some columns clues depends on the answer to row clues and vice versa. And one can extend the chain of dependencies as far as they want, but just make sure that the puzzle is deterministic as a whole

%For example, 7 across could be: a prime number; and 9 down could be: the cube of 7 across, but the grid dictates that the number of digits for 9 down is 4, so that restricts the possible choices for 7 across, and knowing a few digits in either or both clues would make the answers unique

%Some numbers some letters? how will it work? convert words into letters? think about this - it  will be quite ugly doing this

%Need roughly 20 clues. Make the grid in texit

%Maybe have at least one of each type of clue e.g historical, deterministic number etc.

1. Do something like 'a prime number, a cube' which must be determined by other digits
%Flexible: quite a lot especially for length
%Deterministic: Very much so once you have a few digits
%Difficulty: Low

2. I think a 'which integer maxes the value of this integral' is quite cool
%Flexibile: Not very
%Deterministic: 100%
%Difficulty: Can be made higher

3. Some easily evaluatable integrals, of course we can use limits and parameters with clues. Lots of stuff like the denominator of integrals, having things like $x^{7 \text{across}}$ or something. Also, RECURSION RELATIONS are great for several things; maybe the numerator / denominator of some stuff like that. Maybe the 7 acrossth term of some recursion relation. 
%Flexible: Not extremely, the problem with integrals I guess
%Deterministic: Clue REQUIRED
%Difficulty: Very variable

4. Recursion ideas are $\sin^n(x)$ and any shite from step you can pull, perhaps even one of those $x^n$ algebra ones you can just put together yourself - ngl a good idea for the actual competition. I think DUTIS would be lovely too, maybe I can bring back some canned integrals like $x^k \ln^k(x)$. \newline \newline \newline
%Flexible: A little
%Deterministic: I can make it if I want to
%Difficulty: Variable

\section{Recurrence shite}

5. $\int_0^1 \frac{x^n}{(1+x)}$ is an idea but the denominator quickly goes quite bruh.
%FDD is same as above.
%This integral we do by just In+In-1=1/n and set up recurrence kinda zzzz quite easy, I'd say Mid low

6. $\int_0^1 \frac{t^{n-1}}{(1+t)^n} \dd t$
%STEP 2004 S3 Q7 also beta lmao. Use recurrence, maybe mid low

7. $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\sin^n{x}}{2+\sin{x}} \dd x$
%Pick some n which is't thaat high like 3 or 5. From STEP 2013 S3 Q1, difficulty medium. Needs Weierstrass too so it's quite neat.

8. $\int_0^1 x^n \arctan{x} \dd x$ Some time as it contains not just a recurrence.



1. %something which doesn't obviously diverge but does
%ideas are x/x^2+1 from 0 to inf so that the clue is 'infinity' . . . don't thinnk i can use words. Unless I use an I as a 1 ? or even use it as an i as in imaginary! that would be pretty funny. Maybe by calculation or by square rooting somethning negative

%https://www.instagram.com/p/B5-yuM_FbxN/ 
% This is a good integral to use for infinity.

%NON MATH ONES

1. How many years ago was the Riemann integral first published? 
%It was 1868, so the answer is 153. The 1 is quite easy to guess so that can be filled in normally, the others are hard so we can have those as clues to work out
%Any other historical things? Lebesgue integral?
%F: No
%D: Yes, final two digits
%D: Dependent on linking clues


2. How many years ago was the Lebesgue integral first published?
%It was 1904 so it was 117 years. 
%FDD same as above

3. Newton and stuff like that? 
%Maybe keep some historical shite for next year if it goes well


% Which condition characterises Riemann integrability using measure zero sets?  - 
%ANS Lebesgue

%if i want numbers, twist this so that the answer is 0 . . 0 is too short for the crossword format so I need to add it to something

% Stieltjes qns for nerds?

%Who is Differentiation under the integral sign named after?
%Leibniz (share with n on infinity to trick feynman fans)

% What's the name of the person the integral defined by upper and lower sums is named after?
% ANS: Darboux

% What's the opposite of differentiation? 
%integratoin

\section{Shuttle}

%Need 16 questions 

%How long to make this? Test with Archim members, 4-8 minutes?
%https://www.ukmt.org.uk/sites/default/files/ukmt/ptmr/ptmr-sample-shuttle.pdf

%Possible stuff
%Good sources: MIT Integral bee for short qns
%int sin x 0 to pi or something as a start as its easy
% int e^-ax sinx dx from 0 to inf.

%Some quite simple reflection thing for a first qn

%also want some question where you get a parameter which absolutely kills eg a sin0, cos0 or e^0 ? or even an ln0 to get a -infinity answer hahahahahah. WILL NEED TO ANNOUNCE -INFINITY or INFINITY IS VALID ANSWER

%techniques which are valid:

%Weierstrass for Q3,4
%Dutis for Q4
%series for Q2-4
%Reflection for 1-4
%Floor function
%Odd / even / 'adding zero trick'

%3. $\int_a^{-a} e^{\text{some quadratic}} \dd x$
%Complete square
%Could do something interesting like maximum value given some constraints and then force the answer to be pi.
%too easy to be here with infinity as the previous clue
%Next year maybe

Shuttle 1

1. $\int_0^1 \ln^2(x) \dd x$
%Something quite tame. Maybe an even/odd function thing to help simplify it to make it fairly quick.
%Give the answer squared, it'll be 4

2. $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\sin(x)}{\sin(x+\frac{\pi}{a=4}
)} \dd x$ \newline  \newline \newline 
%From MIT Integral bee 2019 or 2020 something
%have the pi/4 be pi/a and pass it on, not possible without a but can do a little intermediate work
%Answer is of the form pi/csqrt(d), either pass or write c.

3. $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\dd x}{1+\tan^{\alpha=whatever you want idc}(x)}$ \newline  \newline \newline  %put in middle of shuttle so everyone is like woah we didnt need to pass the number !  Maybe the number passed to them can be 7945
%Answer pi/4, maybe modify so its integers only, like 1/pi on this ? and a+b
%integral 3

4. Something fairly challenging. Can do one of the indefinites like one of the next year fam problems. 

Shuttle 2

1. $\int_{-1}^1 \frac{x^4+x^3+x}{x^2-9} \dd x$
%Something a bit time consuming and slightly bashy so people check it carefully lmao. Partial fraction sort of thing? Maybe like an $u^4+u^3+u/u^2-1$ from $-1 to 1$?
%Answer is -(81ln(4)-81ln(2)-56)/3 , give the number of factors of 2 in the denominator

2. $\int_0^{a=0} x^3e^{-x} \dd x$ \newline  \newline \newline 
%Do an integral which ends up as 0 because you get the bounds to end up being of 0 length hahahahahahahahahah. Something of moderate difficulty, , , maybe a sin(x^2) so that the mfs cum over fresnel integral? or maybe some aids by parts stuff HAHA (or even troll the gamma mfs)
%maybe have this and then follow up with the ln(ax) one to be an ultimate troll and then have a fairly difficult integral at the end lmfaoooo, probably some dutis or series type thing.

3. Write an integral st 0 isn't obvious. Maybe a floor or series thing.
%Possible idea is lnx/1-x^2 from 0 to 1 with 2sqrt(a); take the irrational part

4. $\int_0^{b=\pi} x\ln(\sin{x}) \dd x$ \newline  \newline \newline 
%Impossible to do unless it's up to pi so do this as an integral 4. 

%Maybe swap shuttle 1 and 2?

Shuttle 3

1. $\int_0^{2 \pi} \sin(\sin(x)-x) \dd x$ \newline  \newline \newline  %do this as integral 1
%Answer 0
%neat reflection

%Something somewhat hard ngl. Maybe a clever sub + reflection? Not obvious the answer is 0, either do a weird integral or mask it by some weird question
2. $\int_{a=0}^{\infty} \ln(1+\frac{169}{x^2}) \dd x$
%III Page 45,46
%Answer is 13pi, maybe say what's the second digit of the answer so that it's 0.

3. $\int_0^{1} \frac{\ln(a=0(x+1))}{x^2+1} \dd x$ \newline  \newline \newline  %integral 2 or 3 ? 
%Serret integral but SIKE it's just -infinity lmaooooooooo, take a=0

4. Something difficult ish, mid low or medium. Maybe a series problem with floor. (to design this pick a series and work backwards). A series I like is Basel, any Zeta thing, Catalan.

Shuttle 4

1. $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0^{a} \arctan(x^n) \dd x$
%Need to decide what number to use for this, maybe to get pi/6 and then say pass the prime factors 

2.$\int_0^1 \frac{x^{a=3}-x^{b=2}}{\ln{x}} \dd x$ \newline  \newline \newline   
%Given two numbers, a>b
%Answer is ln(4/3)
% I want to get two out of this, maybe do like the ceiling of this

3. $\int_0^1 \frac{1-x}{x^a+(x^a+1)^a} \dd x$
%a=2

%Pass on tan(I)+sec(I) of this integral, you get phi

%Solution: https://www.instagram.com/p/CBDTZUrDkL1/
%Possible for rally and then pass onto something that uses phi like these:
% https://www.instagram.com/p/B-j-Ip4jnfg/ - a bit long
% https://www.instagram.com/p/B-mbVhUD-Ye/ - not really special use of phi, just a dutis problem
% https://www.instagram.com/p/B9ugM68JhJ7/ - decent length and not too difficult. 
% https://www.instagram.com/p/CB-A2ULD-8Z/ - answer is 1, need to work out method. Either this or the one above.
% Maybe final shuttle as its quite hard and long ?

4. End with a medium problem.




3. $\int_0^{\pi} \sin(x) \dd x$ \newline  \newline \newline  %integral 1
%Want to put this somewhere lmao maybe in cross integral
%Answer 2









%Idea for a double integral one, take two paramaters e.g take 3,2 . Possible ideas could be 'factors of 6' for this question:





%some medium type stuff

%Look at UKMT Shuttles for interesting ways to report the number which they get e.g I can do wacky stuff like 'numbers of factors of 5 of the answer' and other weird stuff.


%Can do weird limits for tan, cosine integrals and all that stuff

\section{Stuff I haven't decided where to put}

1. $\int_0^{\pi} \frac{x}{1-\sin{x}\cos{x}} \dd x$
% https://www.instagram.com/p/CH8UTRQjACw/
%Possibly shuttle?  

\section{Next year fam / possible this year}

1. $\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2-\frac{1}{2x^2}} \dd x$ Next year fam? \newline  \newline \newline 
%Source: https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/analysis/diffunderint.pdf Problem 9 or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bil0jVleuZI
% Method: DUTIS by introducing t^2/2x^2 - maybe change it to 3^2 on numerator? This is to get people to introduce paramater and change it where necessary
%Answer: sqrt(pi/2) e^-|t| 
%Difficulty: Mid-high possibly to abstruse

2. $\int_0^{\infty} \frac{e^{-pt^2}-e^{-qt^2}}{t^2} \dd t$ Next year ? \newline  \newline \newline 
%Source: III page 90
%Write as double integral, probably better than the cos one which instead could be a relay question?
%Answer: sqrt(pi)(sqrt(q)-sqrt(p))
%Difficulty: Medium

3. $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \sqrt{\tan{x}}\sqrt{1-\tan{x}} \dd x$ Possible next year for high difficulty one \newline  \newline \newline 
%Method: Sub x=root(tan) and sinx  and partial fractions, some other subs too.
%Difficulty: Hard
%Answer: pi \frac{sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}{2}-pi

4.  $\int_0^a \frac{x \dd x}{\cos(x)\cos(a-x)}$ Next year, a great recursion. \newline  \newline \newline 
%https://brilliant.org/discussions/thread/brilliant-integration-contest-season-1-part-2/ Problem 22
%Answer is a/sina lnseca 
%Medium
%This problem is actually amazing, I might try to fit it in Round 1

5. https://www.instagram.com/p/CB8DOqajth4/ 

%Requires euler mascheroni so update syllabus ?

6.  $\int_0^{\pi} \frac{\dd x}{(2+\cos(x))^3} $ Round 1 I think. Consider this for this years round 1 but maybe next too depending on how many weierstrass. \newline  \newline \newline 
%Problem 7 from here : https://brilliant.org/discussions/thread/brilliant-integration-contest-season-1/
%Difficulty: Medium high
%Answer: pi/2root(3)
%This is kinda nice, maybe put it in round 1
% I want this but I don't want too many Weierstrass subs in one year, maybe it'd be good next year? I should decide which Weierstrass ones I want

7. $\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sqrt{x}\arctan(x)}{1+x^2} \dd x$
%Hard and uses beta. From DVKT math, https://www.instagram.com/p/CInh1F8D0AL/.
